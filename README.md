# Tableu
## Overview
### Introduction
You have been asked to help Des Moines to build a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. You have learned a number of things about Tableu to act as the platform for data vizulization. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
## Results
1. For the first analysis we did we wanted to look to see how long people used the bikes and how long the different trips are. This graph shows that as the longer the trip is the more likely people are to use it (* I had issues with my computer on this one. I consolted with the tutors and the AskBCS and we discovered that my computer was not capable of handeling the large size of the data file. This data is incomplete but it was determined that based on the processing power of my computer that it would not be able to handle the capacity*). In the example given on the module challenge we can see that people are more likely to bike for one hour or less.

2. The second analysis that we did roke down the previous graph by gender to see if that had any affect. What we were able to find is that males are much more likely to bike and to bike for longer periods of time. Females followed with the second largest amount of time and duration finally followed by unknown.

3. The third analysis shows what day of the week and what time of that day people are most likely to use the bikes. In this image we can see that during typical communte times is when someone is most likely to use the bikes. The weekends all day during daylight hours are also moderatly popular.

4. We then took the previous graph and looked to see if breaking it down by gender would have any effect. In this it can be seen that, like the second analysis, the males are more likely to use bikes than females but the patterns in the thrid analysis of time of the weekdays was consistent through all genders.

5. In this analysis we wanted to look and see if people were more likely to be subscribers or customers when they use the bike, what day they used the bike, and what gender they were. This combined a lot of our previous analysis findings but what was also seen was that people are more likely to use the bikes if they are subscribers.

6. Finally we wanted to see if there was any differece in where people were more liekly to start or end a journey. Below you can see patterns through out the city. The blue image represents where an individual starts a trip while the red/orange represents where they end a trip. This helps us to understand how people move through the city and where it is important to put more avaiable bike stations.

## Summary
### Summary of Results 
Throughout this analysis there are a couple of main trends that we are able to see appear. One is that men are more liekly to use the bikes than females. Another one is that bikes are most likely to be used during daylight hours, during typical commute times on the weekdays, and all day during the weekend.
### Future graph suggestions
Some suggestions for future analysis may be to look at the ages of people who use the bikes by gender to see if one gender is more liekly to be of a certain age. Another idea for analysis is to look at the bike usage based on the season or weather patterns.
